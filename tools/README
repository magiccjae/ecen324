The files in this folder correspond to two useful programs:

yas   

The Y86 assembler. This takes a Y86 assembly code file with extension
.ys and generates a file with extension .yo. The generated file
contains an ASCII version of the object code, such as that shown in
the text in Figure 4.8.  To assemble the program in
file asum.ys in this directory, we use the command:
unix> yas ./asum.ys

yis

The Y86 instruction simulator. This program executes the
instructions in a Y86 machine-level program according to the
instruction set definition. For example, suppose you want to run the
program asum.yo. Simply run:

 yis ./asum.yo 

YIS simulates the execution of the program
and then prints changes to any registers or memory loca-
tions on the terminal, as described in the text on page 348.
